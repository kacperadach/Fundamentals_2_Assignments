There are 3 classes in my game: Apple, Basket, AppleGame.

The Apple class is the data definition for the falling apples in the game.

The Apple class has 3 data members:
	- x
	- y
	- speed

X and Y describe the location of the Apple and speed is a constant final (= 10) which describes the speed at which the Apple moves.

The Apple class has three methods:
	- moveDown()
	- onTheGround()
	- fall()

moveDown() simply returns an Apple with its y increased by the speed.
onTheGround() returns a boolean of where an Apple has reached the bottom of the game screen.
fall() uses the two prior function to determine what kind of Apple should be returned. If the apple returns false for onTheGround() it just uses moveDown() but if it returns true, a new Apple is created with random x and y.

The Basket class has 3 data members:
	- speed
	- length
	- x

Speed and length are constant finals that describe the speed at which the basket moves and the length of the basket. X describes the position of the basket.

The Basket class has one method:
	- moveOnKey(String ke)

moveOnKey(String ke) takes the String ke, if ke is "left" then the function returns a new Basket with the x moved by the speed to the left, and to the right for "right". Any other input is ignored.


The AppleGame class has 5 data members:
	- width
	- height
	- caught
	- a
	- b

Width and height describe the dimensions of the game scene. Caught is the number of apples caught, a is an arraylist of apples, and b is the basket.

The AppleGame class has 3 methods:
	- caughtApple(Apple a, Basket b)
	- onTick()
	- onKeyEvent(String ke)
	- worldEnds()
	- makeScene()

CaughtApple(Apple a, Basket b) takes a basket and an apple and returns a boolean value equal to whether that apple is caught in that basket.
onTick() tells the game how to move the apples on each clock tick.
onKeyEvent(String ke) takes a string keyvalue and uses the basket moveOnKey to control the backet
worldEnds() is a function that dictates when the game is over and what scene to show.
makeScene() is the drawing function that draws each frame.
